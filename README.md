## Problem statement

AtliQ Hardware is a company that delivers computer hardware and peripherals to clients across multiple branches in India. The sales director is struggling to understand the company's performance and identify the challenges causing sales to decline gradually. When he contacts regional managers for updates on sales and market conditions, they often struggle to interpret the numbers in Excel files, leading to frustration and difficulty in making informed decisions.

## Solution

The sales director of AtliQ Hardware decided to build a PowerBI dashboard to convert data into visual representations, enabling data-driven decisions. To accomplish this, he hired a team of data experts to complete the task.
